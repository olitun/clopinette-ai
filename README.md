# ClopinetteAI

Cloudflare-native AI agent with persistent memory, a built-in skills hub, multimodal I/O, and Telegram / WhatsApp / Discord bots out of the box. One Durable Object per user, serverless, BYOK-ready.

> *Clopinette* = French for "next to nothing". An AI agent that costs clopinettes to run.

Inspired by [hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) (Nous Research). Clean-room TypeScript rewrite for Cloudflare.

## How it works

```
        Web / Telegram / WhatsApp / Discord / Evolution / MCP
                              │
                              ▼
                   Hono worker  (clopinette-ai)
                              │
                              ▼
              ClopinetteAgent Durable Object
                (one per user, SQLite + R2)
                              │
                              ▼
         runPipeline() ──► LLM  +  tool layer  +  5 memory layers
```

Every user gets an isolated Durable Object with its own SQLite, its own `MEMORY.md` / `USER.md`, and its own skills. The agent streams over WebSocket on the web UI and replies to Telegram / WhatsApp / Discord via webhooks. Telegram, WhatsApp, and Discord can be linked to a web account with `/link` so the bot shares memory across channels.

Supporting Cloudflare services (used transparently):
- **Queues** — usage reports, retry-safe with DLQ
- **Workflows** — async delegation (sub-agents) and one-shot Vectorize backfill
- **Vectorize** — hybrid keyword + semantic search on chat history (bge-m3, RRF fusion)
- **Cron** — the gateway syncs D1 → KV quota every 5 min

## Features

- **Chat** — streaming WebSocket with Markdown, images, voice, drag-and-drop upload
- **Tool-driven runtime** — web, docs, memory, history, skills, notes, calendar, todo, image, tts, clarify, with optional browser, delegation, and codemode
- **5-layer memory** — MEMORY.md / USER.md, hybrid FTS5+Vectorize session search, memory flush, skills index, optional Honcho
- **Multi-platform** — Telegram, WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API + self-hosted Evolution/Baileys), Discord (slash commands + DM bridge), MCP
- **14 personality presets** — helpful, concise, technical, kawaii, pirate, shakespeare, noir, uwu, etc. (`/personality`)
- **Skills Hub** — install skills from the built-in catalog or trusted GitHub repos like Hermes, Cloudflare, MiniMax, and gstack
- **Hub hardening** — scans imported skills for prompt-injection / exfiltration structure before install, while preserving trusted security and red-team bundles
- **BYOK** — bring your own key across 13 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI Studio, Groq, xAI/Grok, Mistral, DeepSeek, Cohere, Perplexity, OpenRouter, Cerebras, HuggingFace, Replicate) via the Cloudflare AI Gateway. On the hosted SaaS the BYOK plan is free — you only pay your provider
- **BYOK media models** — image generation, TTS, and voice transcription can run on the user's own key via the provider's OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/images/generations`, `/audio/speech`, `/audio/transcriptions`), configured in Settings → AI Provider
- **Cross-provider auxiliary** — e.g. primary OpenAI + auxiliary Anthropic for the fast-path / compression
- **Self-learning** — the agent updates its own memory after N turns
- **Async delegation with auto-resume** — web-only research sub-agents run in parallel via Cloudflare Workflows. When the last delegate finishes, the agent automatically synthesizes their results and pushes the final reply via the originating gateway (web / Telegram / WhatsApp / Discord). No need to send a follow-up message.
- **Multimodal** — vision (images), Whisper (voice), PDF / DOCX / XLSX / text extraction

## Tools

Primary tools available to the agent:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `web` | Search, read URL, scrape, extract, crawl, diagnostics (SearXNG / Brave / Browser Run quick actions) |
| `docs` | RAG search + Q&A over user-uploaded documents (AutoRAG) |
| `history` | Hybrid keyword + semantic search across past conversations |
| `memory` | Read / write persistent `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` |
| `skills` | Load, create, edit, and inspect reusable `SKILL.md` files with compact indexing and platform filters |
| `notes` | Personal notes with URL enrichment |
| `calendar` | Events + one-shot reminders delivered on all platforms |
| `todo` | Task list |
| `image` | Image generation (FLUX Schnell on Workers AI, or the user's own media model on BYOK) |
| `tts` | Text-to-speech (Deepgram Aura on Workers AI — 12 voices — or the user's own TTS model on BYOK) |
| `clarify` | Ask the user a structured question mid-execution |
| `browser` | Playwright MCP (navigate, click, type, snapshot, diagnostics, human handoff) — conditional |
| `delegate` | Run parallel web-only research sub-agents in the background — conditional |

With codemode active (when the `LOADER` binding is set), the LLM writes JavaScript that orchestrates internal state tools in one step instead of spending tokens on repetitive tool chatter.

### Skills Hub

- Browse installable skills from the built-in catalog or trusted GitHub repos (`Hermes`, `Cloudflare`, `MiniMax`, `gstack`).
- Imported skills can carry support files such as `references/`, `templates/`, and `scripts/` when they are text-based.
- Hub installs are scanned for structural prompt-injection, secret-exfiltration, and dangerous URI patterns before they are written to user storage.

### Browser Run observability

- `browser({ action: "diagnostics" })` returns operator guidance for Browser Run Live View and Human in the Loop.
- `browser({ action: "request_human", reason: "..." })` produces a structured handoff when login, MFA, CAPTCHA, or sensitive data entry blocks automation.
- `web` responses backed by Browser Run quick actions now include `browserRun.sessionId`, `browserRun.browserMsUsed`, and `browserRun.cfRay` when Cloudflare returns them.
- Browser Run Live View / HITL are available for active browser sessions. In this codebase, the current `@cloudflare/playwright-mcp` wrapper does not expose the Browser Run session ID or direct Live View URL in tool results, so the operator flow is:

```bash
wrangler browser list
wrangler browser view <SESSION_ID>
```

- Browser Run Session Recordings require launching a browser session with `recording: true`. The current Playwright MCP wrapper used by Clopinette does not expose a recording toggle yet.

## Slash commands

Work on every platform (web, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord).

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/status` | Model, tokens, session info |
| `/research <topic>` (alias `/deepsearch`) | Deep research with parallel sub-agents (auto-synthesized reply) |
| `/model [provider id]` | Show or switch the active LLM (plan-aware) |
| `/insights` | Usage breakdown by model this month |
| `/memory` | Show MEMORY.md and USER.md |
| `/soul` | Show SOUL.md personality (`/soul reset` to restore default) |
| `/personality [name]` | Switch personality or list the 14 presets |
| `/session` | Session info + auto-reset config |
| `/skills` | List installed skills |
| `/search <query>` | Search past conversations |
| `/note [text]` | Save a note (no text = show recent) |
| `/notes` | List all notes grouped by day |
| `/forget` | Clear memory |
| `/reset` or `/clear` | Reset current session |
| `/wipe CONFIRM` | Delete everything except your BYOK provider config |
| `/link` | Identity linking (handled per platform: Telegram prompts, WhatsApp + Discord have `/link trusted` / `/link shared` for group modes) |
| `/help` | List all commands |

## Inference

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Workers AI tier | Kimi K2.6 + Gemma 4 26B + GLM 4.7 Flash (free for trial / pro) |
| Internal / auxiliary | Gemma 4 26B — compression, self-learning, web summarization, browser snapshots |
| BYOK | 13 providers via AI Gateway, per-provider config, cross-provider auxiliary |
| BYOK enforcement | BYOK plan never touches Workers AI — chat, compression, self-learning, and delegates run on the user's own provider, and managed media (FLUX, Aura, Whisper) is trial/pro only unless the user configures their own media models |
| Max steps | 6 parent, 2 delegate |
| Context compression | Structured summary at 40+ messages |
| Prefix caching | Workers AI session affinity + system prompt cached per session (byte-identical prefix across turns) |
| Usage accounting | Sum of all steps per turn (`totalUsage`) — multi-step tool turns are fully counted |
| Error recovery | 429/529 → fallback to Workers AI default for trial / pro. BYOK surfaces the original provider error (no silent Workers AI fallback). Mid-stream errors are classified and pushed to the client over WebSocket. |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.1+
- [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) v4+
- Cloudflare account (Workers Paid plan)

### Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marceloeatworld/clopinette-ai.git
cd clopinette-ai
cp wrangler.example.jsonc wrangler.jsonc
bun install

# Storage
wrangler r2 bucket create clopinette-memories
wrangler r2 bucket create clopinette-skills
wrangler kv namespace create LINKS

# Queues (retry-safe usage reports)
wrangler queues create clopinette-usage
wrangler queues create clopinette-usage-dlq

# Vectorize (hybrid semantic search, 1024-d for bge-m3)
wrangler vectorize create clopinette-sessions --dimensions=1024 --metric=cosine
wrangler vectorize create-metadata-index clopinette-sessions --property-name=userId --type=string
wrangler vectorize create-metadata-index clopinette-sessions --property-name=sessionId --type=string

# Required secrets
wrangler secret put MASTER_KEY           # openssl rand -base64 32
wrangler secret put CF_ACCOUNT_ID
wrangler secret put CF_GATEWAY_ID
wrangler secret put WS_SIGNING_SECRET    # openssl rand -base64 32 (shared with the gateway)
wrangler secret put API_AUTH_KEY

# Deploy — Workflows (delegation, vector backfill) are auto-created
bun run deploy
```

### Telegram

```bash
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
bun run deploy
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/admin/setup-telegram \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_AUTH_KEY"
```

### WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API)

```bash
wrangler secret put WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN
wrangler secret put WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN
wrangler secret put WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET
wrangler secret put WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID
# Set webhook URL in Meta portal: https://your-worker.workers.dev/webhook/whatsapp
```

### Discord

Two channels: **Interactions** (slash commands, zero setup) and **Gateway bridge** (DM / @mentions, needs a small external Docker service).

```bash
wrangler secret put DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
wrangler secret put DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID
wrangler secret put DISCORD_TOKEN
bun run deploy

# Register slash commands + generate bridge secret
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/admin/setup-discord \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_AUTH_KEY"
# Returns: { interactionsUrl, bridgeUrl, bridgeSecret }

# For natural DM / @mention chat (optional):
cd workers/discord-bridge
# Set env: DISCORD_TOKEN, BRIDGE_SECRET, WORKER_URL
docker compose up -d
```

Slash commands (`/ask`, `/status`, `/memory`, etc.) work immediately. The bridge is only needed if you want full conversation in DMs and @mentions.

### Optional secrets

```bash
# Web search backends (automatic fallback: SearXNG → Brave → Browser Run)
wrangler secret put SEARXNG_URL          # self-hosted SearXNG URL
wrangler secret put BRAVE_API_KEY        # free tier: 2000 queries/month
wrangler secret put CF_BROWSER_TOKEN     # last resort + read/extract/crawl

# Optional GitHub token for Hub indexing / install rate limits
wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN

# Evolution API (self-hosted WhatsApp via Baileys)
wrangler secret put EVOLUTION_API_URL
wrangler secret put EVOLUTION_API_KEY
```
